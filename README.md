Unmerged country IP blocks for DevOps

I want to say a big thank you to @herrbischoff for his work.

Small remark: I would add all countries, but all CD\CI GitHub work is limited to 6 hours on the free plan. You can add your own countries of interest by forking and editing the ISO country code in the Workflow file.
